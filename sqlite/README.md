### 1. Collect Data (SQLite)

Create an ETL script to pull data from the web an store it in a SQLite database. A SQLite databases is simply a file that is stored on your workstation. Think of it as directory with many text files that you can access with SQL. You can run your ETL script several times to create a database of Bitcoin exchange rates over time.

### 2. Create Content (Apps, Reports, and API's)

After you have stored several snapshots of Bitcoin exchange rates into your database, you can build content on top of it. For example, you can build a Shiny application, an R Markdown document, and Plumber API.

### 3. Publishing and Share (RStudio Connect)

Finally, you can publish your work to RStudio Connect. You can use RStudio Connect to control access, distribute content, and automate your work. Here is an example app, report, and API published to RStudio Connect along with the automated ETL script:
